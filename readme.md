## About me

My journey to the IT world begun in 2020 with the indescribable help of Maciej Korsan, my first mentor. I was interested in programming long before 2020, but due to being very uncertain person about what I **_really_** want to do with my life it took me long enough to finally understand it. I'm working on macOS, and some even say, that I'm an Apple fanboy. I'm trying to become an iOS developer, and from what I've discovered, many frontend developers switched to mobile apps, which is somewhat nice. My goal is to got a job as an iOS dev before the end of 2023 (it's really small amount of time tbh).
